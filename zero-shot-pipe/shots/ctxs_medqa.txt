Nitrofurantoin is a commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) in pregnant women. It is considered safe during pregnancy and is effective against common pathogens causing UTIs. Ampicillin and ceftriaxone are not the first-line choices for treating uncomplicated UTIs, and doxycycline is contraindicated in pregnancy due to potential adverse effects on fetal development.
Placing the infant in a supine position on a firm mattress while sleeping is the recommended precaution to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). This position helps maintain clear airways and minimizes the risk of suffocation. Avoiding practices such as covering the infant excessively, using devices to maintain sleeping position, and prohibiting pacifier use during sleep are not recommended and may pose additional risks.
