Persistent obstruction of urine flow, as seen in benign prostatic hyperplasia, can result in increased pressure within the urinary system. This elevated pressure may eventually lead to atrophy of the kidney parenchyma. Atrophy refers to the shrinking or reduction in size of an organ or tissue, and in this context, it reflects the consequence of long-term obstruction on the affected kidney.
Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is primarily found in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. It is not naturally present in significant amounts in plant-based foods, making it essential for individuals following a vegetarian or vegan diet to obtain this vitamin through fortified foods or supplements. In contrast, Vitamin C, Vitamin B7 (biotin), and Vitamin D can be obtained from both animal and plant sources.
